# ECE_3140_Spring_2024_Final_Project_PONG
This is the repository for my final project that Tate Finley and I did for Dr. JW Bruce's ECE 3140 class

The target hardware that we used for this project was the DE-10 Lite from TerASIC Inc.
The board can be found at the following link:

The HTML file "project_pong.rst" contains all of the design requirements and specifications that we were asked to meet and, if possible, exceed.
